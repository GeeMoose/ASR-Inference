# This file is intentionally left empty as the decode functionality
# is now handled directly in the model.py file for the sense-voice model.
# The original decode.py contained functions for RNN-T models which are not used
# by the sense-voice model implementation. SO I DON'T NEED TO LOAD EDCODER AND PROCESS IT.
